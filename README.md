# PySearch

PySearch is a simple search tool for local use on unix based computers. Made as a summer programming project by
Hans CT Jenvild og Arild Lilleg?rd. The goal of the project is to gain experience working with projects. A focus we have
is to use test-driven development.

## Getting Started
PySearch is not yet ready to be downloaded and installed smoothly. Feel free to try making it work your self.
